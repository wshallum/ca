Note: do not use for anything serious.

This program was written to help me graduate back in 2007. It also doubles as
a GUI CA application, much like tinyCA, but using cryptlib instead of OpenSSL.

This is technically security software, but this has just enough coding done to
let me graduate. I really doubt if it is secure enough in places (e.g. temp
files, buffers, passwords). It also has a nasty habit of exiting immediately if
anything unexpected happens.

Suggested alternatives are: 
 - tinyCA
 - OpenSSL "ca" command
 - GnuTLS "certtool" command

Requirements:
 - Cryptlib header and static library
   - please copy to cryptlib/include/cryptlib.h and cryptlib/lib/libcl.a
 - pkg-config, and the .pc files for:
   - GTK+-2.0
   - libglade

Configuring
 - The built files (Makefile.in, configure, etc.) are not included. Rebuild
   using autogen.sh (tested on whatever versions are in CentOS 7)
 - The default prefix is /opt/LMZca. Change if you want to.
 - The path to the *.glade files depends on the prefix, so by default 
   the program cannot be run without installing. Pass --enable-development
   to configure to compile a program that can be run without being installed
   (it will look for *.glade files inside src/gui).

I'm not saying you should use it, but if you do, you get these...

Features:
 - Stores multiple CAs in one sqlite3 database
 - Exports CA certificate and signed certificates in DER / PEM
 - Imports PKCS#10 CSR and stores in requests table
 - Signs CSR with selectable key usage and validity
 - Revokes signed certificates
 - Renews signed certificates
 - Exports CRL
 - Syncs with "web database" (NOTE: webapp not included)

Known misfeatures:
 - Since the individual revocations are signed by signing an in-memory struct,
   it is not portable.
